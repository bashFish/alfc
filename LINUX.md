# Aorus Laptop Fan Control (alfc) - Linux Guide

## IMPORTANT

**Only use this on Linux if your machine is listed in the compatibility table in the main readme or if you know what you're doing.**

Because on Linux, this tool writes directly to hardware addresses where data persists after rebooting. If something goes wrong, you might need to do something [like this](https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/wiki/FAQ#is-there-a-way-to-reset-my-notebook-if-something-went-wrong).

As for how to figure out whether the addresses are the same on your machine â€“ not that simple, I might do a talk or write an article at some point. Let me know if you actually need this.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Needs to be available to root - see e.g. https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions )
- Installing the kernel module [acpi_call](https://github.com/nix-community/acpi_call) and running it on startup. (Enables issuing of fan control commands.)

### Installing `acpi_call`

Linux pros - feel free to contribute either to the following guide or automating the 
workflow! ðŸ™‚ (See notes in the Wishlist section though.)

If you've never installed a kernel module, one way is like the following (If you have secure boot 
enabled, you need to do [this](https://gist.github.com/s-h-a-d-o-w/53c2215e955c3326c6ec8f812a0d2f27) first. 
Plus, `make` might complain if you're missing compilers but it worked out of the box on Mint for me.):

```
sudo make dkms-add
sudo make dkms-build
sudo make dkms-install
sudo modprobe acpi_call
```

### Running `acpi_call` on startup

If your distro uses systemd, you can use [this really simple method](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_module#Automatic_module_loading_with_systemd). Installing makes `acpi_call` available to be loaded just like described there.

If it doesn't, I'm afraid you'll have to do research yourself.

## Installation

- Grab the latest release, extract it to wherever you want alfc to live and run 
`install.sh`

A service for alfc will be created and started.

## Wishlist

- Somehow including `acpi_call` in the installation process. But there are two problems:
    1. People who have secure boot enabled need that whole separate step of signing the module.
    2. How the module can be loaded on startup might vary from distro to distro.
